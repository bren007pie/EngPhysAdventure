# **Bugs**
- [ ] If crashes then gave saves may break the game due to giving the object then brekaing on quest
- [ ] When game is loaded with mismatched items it will break in the middle of the loading loop causing many of the
    things to not be loaded even if they're fine. It needs a save reconsiler that removes the wrong object.
- [ ] still a problem with layers, saving and loading, hope it works for 0.27 release
- [ ] Save files in the wrong location? Where is Doug?
- [ ] Can't play as tyler Kashak after you stop
- [ ] When you exit from the start screen or otherwise the error catcher catches you
- [ ] Check to make sure nest game, correct times, and everything add up
